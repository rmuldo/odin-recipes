        <p><strong>Yield:</strong> 8 servings</p>
        <p><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
        <p><strong>Cook Time:</strong> 30 minutes</p>
        <p><strong>Total Time:</strong> 40 minutes</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 2/3 cups all-purpose flour (plus a bit extra for dusting surfaces)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher or sea salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1 3/4 cups buttermilk</li>
                <li>Nonstick cooking spray</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oven to 425 degress F.  Oil a medium cast iron skillet and set aside.</li>
                <li>Mix flour, salt, and baking soda together in a mixing bowl.  Make a well in the center and 
                    pour in the buttermilk.  Mix together using your hands until a soft dough forms.  The 
                    dough should be failry wet (like biscuit dough), but not too sticky.</li>

                    an 8-inch flat circle.  Place the loaf on the prepared cast iron and cut a cross from edge 
                    to edge about 1/4 inch deep into the top using a sharp knife dusted in flour.</li>
                <li>Bake in heated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until golden or when the bread sounds hollow when tapped.</li>
                <li>Transfer to a wire rack and cool slightly.</li>
                <li>Serve warm with plenty of butter, <a href="../applebutter/applebutter.html">apple butter</a>, or as a side to mop up juices.</li>
